In the automotive industry, maintaining both functional safety and cybersecurity is of utmost importance. The two primary standards that address these aspects are ISO 26262 and ISO/SAE 21434. ISO 26262 is dedicated to functional safety, while ISO/SAE 21434 pertains to cybersecurity. This blog post examines the relationship between these two standards and how they work together to enhance the overall safety and security of modern vehicles.

## Complementary Nature of ISO 26262 and ISO/SAE 21434

| Standard      | Title                                     | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ISO 26262     | Road vehicles – Functional safety         | Guidelines for the functional safety of electrical and electronic (E/E) systems in road vehicles |
| ISO/SAE 21434 | Road vehicles – Cybersecurity engineering | Framework for managing cybersecurity risks in road vehicles  |

While ISO 26262 and ISO/SAE 21434 address distinct aspects of vehicle safety, they are designed to complement each other:

- ISO 26262 applies to safety-related systems that incorporate one or more electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems in series production road vehicles. It identifies potential hazards resulting from malfunctioning behaviour of safety-related E/E systems, including their interactions.
- Conversely, ISO/SAE 21434 establishes a structured approach for managing cybersecurity risks in road vehicles, ensuring that cybersecurity measures are incorporated throughout the entire vehicle lifecycle.

The integration of these standards provides a comprehensive approach to vehicle safety and security. By aligning functional safety and cybersecurity requirements, manufacturers can develop vehicles that meet both safety and security criteria. This approach supports the implementation of "security by design" principles across the automotive industry.

## Key Areas of Integration

1. Lifecycle Coverage: Both standards address the entire lifecycle of vehicle E/E systems, from initial concept and development to production, operation, and decommissioning. This comprehensive approach ensures that safety and security considerations are integrated at every stage of the vehicle's lifecycle. The application of these standards throughout the lifecycle facilitates early detection and mitigation of risks.
2. Risk Management: Risk management is crucial in both ISO 26262 and ISO/SAE 21434. ISO 26262 targets functional malfunctions, while ISO/SAE 21434 addresses cybersecurity threats. HARA (Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment) and TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment) are used to evaluate risks in these areas. Integrating these methods helps manufacturers create a comprehensive risk management strategy for functional safety and cybersecurity.
3. Compliance and Auditing: Both standards offer comprehensive guidelines for compliance and auditing. By harmonizing these requirements from ISO 26262 and ISO/SAE 21434, manufacturers can optimize their compliance processes and ensure adherence to both safety and security standards.

## Conclusion

In summary, ISO 26262 and ISO/SAE 21434 serve as complementary standards that address distinct aspects of vehicular safety and security. By incorporating both functional safety and cybersecurity requirements, manufacturers are able to produce vehicles that meet stringent safety and security standards. This comprehensive approach ensures modern vehicles are well-equipped to manage the intricate challenges presented by the current automotive landscape.
